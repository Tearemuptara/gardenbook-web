# User Authentication Feature Testing Results

## Test Results for Issue #14 Subtasks 1 & 2

### 1. Enhanced User Data Model
- ✅ Successfully created a new user with enhanced fields (username, email, password, displayName, role, preferences)
- ✅ Verified that passwords are properly hashed (using bcrypt)
- ✅ Verified email validation functionality works correctly:
  - ✅ Valid email formats are accepted
  - ✅ Invalid email formats are rejected with appropriate error messages

### 2. User Authentication Functions
- ✅ Verified `authenticateUser` function correctly validates email/password combinations:
  - ✅ Authenticated successfully with correct credentials
  - ✅ Failed authentication with incorrect password
- ✅ Verified password reset token generation and verification:
  - ✅ Generated password reset token with expiration date
  - ✅ Successfully reset password using token
  - ✅ Verified new password works for authentication
- ✅ Verified email verification token generation and verification:
  - ✅ Generated verification token
  - ✅ Successfully verified email with token
  - ✅ Confirmed user.isVerified flag is set to true after verification

## Testing Details
All tests were conducted by directly accessing the user model functions since the authentication endpoints are not yet exposed in the API.

## MongoDB Data Model
The user data model includes all required fields as specified:
```json
{
  "_id": "ObjectId",
  "username": "string",
  "email": "string",
  "password": "string (hashed)",
  "displayName": "string",
  "role": "string",
  "preferences": {
    "theme": "string",
    "notifications": "boolean"
  },
  "isVerified": "boolean",
  "verificationToken": "string",
  "resetPasswordToken": "string",
  "resetPasswordExpires": "date",
  "refreshTokens": "array",
  "createdAt": "date",
  "updatedAt": "date"
}
```

## Next Steps
- Expose REST API endpoints for authentication functions (login, logout, register, forgot password, reset password, verify email)
- Implement frontend UI for authentication flows
- Add additional security measures like rate limiting and CSRF protection
